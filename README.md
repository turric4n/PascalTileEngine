# Features
* Written in portable Pascal (FPC and Delphi)
* LGPL v2.1 license: free for any project, including commercial ones
* Cross platform: available builds for Windows (32/64), Linux PC(32/64), Mac OS X and Raspberry Pi using FPC
* High performance: Wrapper is made using native lightweight OOP Pascal (no VM or garbage collector environment)

* Fully playable shooter example made in OOP

# Requirements
As OpenSource project, I recommend to use FPC but is fine Delphi Community (Free) to compile too. Delphi has sightly 
better perfomance in Windows but FreePascal is a real multiarch. Firemonkey is not supported yet... if you want Android definetly 
go to FPC.

# Installing
Setup will checkout dependancies and will try to build everything to work with native library.

## Windows
```
> setup.cmd
```

## Debian-based linux
```
> sudo ./setup
```

# Performance
Our wrapper is near or equal performance as plain C.

Warning!!! on latest versions of Raspbian (Stretch) don't use repo SDL2 lib perfomance is AWFUL. 
Compile it yourserlf, parameters : 
```
./configure --prefix=/usr --host=armv7l-raspberry-linux-gnueabihf --disable-pulseaudio --disable-esd --disable-video-mir --disable-video-wayland --disable-video-x11 --disable-video-opengl --disable-static
